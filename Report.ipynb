    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is generative probabilitistic model dealing with collections of data such as corpus. Based on the assumption of `bag of word` and exchangeability, each document in corpus is modeled as random mixture over latent topics and each topic is modeled by a distribution over words. Document is represented in a form of topic probability. In this project, we foucs on the text data, and in this case, each document is represented as a topic probability. We implement variational inference and `EM` algorithm to estimate parameters and performed ** optimazation method to make our algorithm more efficient.
